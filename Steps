Step 1: Define Features & Requirements
Before coding, list out the core functionalities:

Reminders Based on Location

Example: "Drink water" when at the gym.
Example: "Take medicine" when at home.
Health Monitoring

Track activity (steps, time at the gym, etc.).
Track reminders for water, medicines, etc.
Family Ping Feature

Notify family members of your location.
Send an alert in emergencies.
Google Maps API Integration

Get the userâ€™s current location.
Track family members on a map.


Step 2: Set Up Your Development Environment

Step 3: Get Google Maps API Key
Go to Google Cloud Console.
Create a new project.
Enable Google Maps API.
Generate an API key and store it securely.

Step 4: Set Up Firebase for Storing Data
Since you'll be tracking multiple users, use Firebase for real-time database management.

Go to Firebase Console.
Create a new project.
Set up Firestore Database to store user data.
Enable Firebase Authentication (users will log in using Google or email).
Download the firebase-adminsdk.json and add it to your project.


Step 5: Build the Backend (Flask API)
You'll need a Flask server to handle:

Location updates from the user.
Checking reminders based on the user's location.
Sending notifications to family members.

Step 6: Build a Simple Mobile UI

Step 7: Set Up Automated Reminders

Step 8: Deploy the App
